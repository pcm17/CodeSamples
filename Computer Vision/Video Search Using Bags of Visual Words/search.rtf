\f0\fs24 \cf0 My region queries has something wrong with it, I think its in the computeBOWRep function.. I had some trouble picking a good k. Nevertheless I picked 5 query images with distinct patterns in them that I used as the query region. None of the top choices are anything like the query image. I tried doing queries with the entire image instead of a just a region and the results were the same, no relevant images were retrieved. }
